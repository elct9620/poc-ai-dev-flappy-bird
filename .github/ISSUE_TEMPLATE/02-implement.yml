        ## Implement Feature

        This template is for implementing features. Claude Code will automatically find related design documents if they exist.

        **You can:**
        - Specify design document paths if you know them
        - Let Claude find the design documents based on feature name
        - Request implementation even without formal design (Claude will use best practices)

      placeholder: |
        Describe what to implement:
        - Which entities/systems/components?
        - Are there any parts to exclude?
        - Any specific priorities or ordering?

        - [ ] All entities are implemented with correct properties
        - [ ] Systems handle all events specified in design
        - [ ] Components render correctly
        - [ ] All BDD scenarios pass
        - [ ] Code follows project conventions

        ## Claude Command

        This issue will trigger: `/implement [feature name]`

        ## Next Steps

        After submitting this issue:
        1. Add a comment with `@claude` to trigger the implementation
        2. Claude will search for related design documents based on feature name
        3. Claude will implement the feature following the architecture
        4. Claude will create/update BDD tests
        5. You'll receive a summary of what was implemented
