        Explain the gap and the desired behavior:

        **What's missing:**
        "The current design doesn't specify what happens when the bird hits the top of the screen"

        **What should happen:**
        "When the bird reaches the top, it should stop moving upward and start falling"

        **Why it matters:**
        "Without this, the bird can fly off-screen infinitely, which breaks the game"

      required: true
