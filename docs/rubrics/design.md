# Design Rubric

This document outlines the criteria for evaluating the quality of design document. We assert at least 80% of the criteria must be met to pass.

## Criteria

### Formatting and Structure (1 point)

The design document should follow template structure and formatting guidelines.

For example:

- The `entity` should follow `docs/tmplates/entity.md`.
- The `system` should follow `docs/tmplates/system.md`.
- The `component` should follow `docs/tmplates/component.md`.
- The `event` should follow `docs/tmplates/event.md`.

### Avoid Over-Engineering (1 point)

If the data, function, property is not necessary for the current scope or stage, avoid adding them to the design document.
Keep the design small and focused on the current requirements, and avoid speculative additions.

### Clarity and Readability (1 point)

The design document should be non-technical and easy to understand for all team members.

- Explain why certain design choices were made.
- Write without technical jargon or complex language.
- Use diagrams or visual aids where appropriate to enhance understanding.
- Focus on value and purpose rather than implementation details.

### Consistency (1 point)

All design documents should maintain a consistent style and format throughout the project.

- Check related design documents for consistency in terminology and structure.
- Ensure that naming conventions are followed consistently.
- Use same style for naming entities, systems, components, and events across documents.

### Glossary and Definitions (1 point)

Take care to define any new terms or concepts introduced in the design document.

- Check index of glossary for existing definitions, e.g. `docs/entities.md`, `docs/systems.md`, `docs/components.md`, `docs/events.md`.
- Ensure that definitions are clear and unambiguous.
- Avoid using undefined terms or jargon without explanation.
- Keep index of glossary up to date with new definitions as needed.
