        ## Design New Feature

        This template helps you describe **what** you want and **why** you need it. Focus on the desired behavior and user value - Claude will handle all technical decisions.

        **You don't need to know:**
        - Which architecture layers to use (Entity/System/Renderer)
        - How many design documents to create
        - Technical implementation details

        **Just describe:**
        - What you want the feature to do
        - Why users need it
        - How it should behave (using scenarios)

        Describe what you want this feature to do. For example:
        - What should happen when the user interacts?

        Scenario: Bird falls due to gravity
          Given the game has started
          And the bird is in the air
          When no input is received
          Then the bird should accelerate downward
          And the bird's vertical position should decrease

        Scenario: Bird jumps when tapped
          Given the game is running
          And the bird is falling
          When the player taps the screen
          Then the bird should move upward
          And the falling speed should reset
