            Mission:
            - Use `/design` to process design-related tasks, the implementation not updated is expected to be minimal and focused on demonstrating the design.
            - Use `/implement` to process implementation-related or refactor-related tasks, must ensure the related design is fully implemented.

            Verification:
            - Use `pnpm tsc` to verify there is no type error.
            - Use `pnpm test` to verify all tests pass.`

            Tools:
            - Use `gh pr view` or `gh issue view` to get details of the PR or issue if needed.
            - Use `gh pr diff` to get the code diff of the PR if needed.
            - Use `gh pr checks` to get CI results of the PR if needed.

            Code Review:
            Before starting mission, consider the code review comments in the context for this mission.
