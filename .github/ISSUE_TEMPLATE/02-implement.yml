        ## Implement Feature

        Describe the feature you want to implement. Claude will automatically find related design documents and handle the technical implementation.

        **You don't need to know:**
        - Where design documents are located (Claude finds them automatically)
        - Which architecture layers to modify (entities/systems/renderers)
        - How to write tests (Claude creates them)

        **Just describe:**
        - What feature you want implemented
        - Any specific priorities or parts to focus on

        ## Claude Command

        This issue will trigger: `/implement [feature name]`

        ## Next Steps

        After submitting this issue:
        1. Add a comment with `@claude` to trigger the implementation
        2. Claude will search for related design documents based on feature name
        3. Claude will implement the feature following the architecture
        4. Claude will create/update BDD tests
        5. You'll receive a summary of what was implemented
